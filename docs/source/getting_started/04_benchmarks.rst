CV Model Benchmarks
*******************

At PeekingDuck, we aim to give users as much flexibility as possible to cater to every possible use case.
From real-time object detection to high-accuracy pose estimation, PeekingDuck houses a wide range of models.
The full list of models can be found :mod:`here <peekingduck.pipeline.nodes.model>`.

We are currently running benchmarks on model performance and FPS, and will be updating this document with our benchmark results.
We hope that this would allow users to have a quick understanding on the relative performance of each model, thereby enabling
users to decide on the model most suited for their use case.
